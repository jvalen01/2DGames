# Arkanoid game

### Rules
Simple interactive game that includes text, picture, sound and controlled by keyboard or mouse. 

### Basic goals and functioning of the game:
- Should be 3 different levels. 
- Hit every bar to progress to next level. 
- You lose if the ball hit the ground. 
- Have to implement collision logic with bars, paddle and walls.

### MVC pattern:

In this case the model represents the game state, such as the position of the ball, 
the position of the paddle, and the score

The view in this case represents the visual elements of the game, such as the canvas and the graphics.

The controller in this case represents the user input and the game logic, such as collision detection and updating the game state.
